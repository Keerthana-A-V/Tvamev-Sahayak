## Tvamev Sahayak | <i>Be Your Own Healer</i>

त्वमेव is the hindi word for "you" and सहायक is Hindi for "assistant/helper". Together when combined Tvamev Sahayak means you are a helper. Tvamev Sahayak is built on the principle that everyone is a helper and we encourage the use of <b>empathy</b> and not sympathy. It envisions to grow as an idea across regions, economies and countries using this principle that everyone is born a helper and it is our duty to help others in becoming their own and others' helpers.
